### Notes
I had trouble loading the grid page and after talking to the TA, it turns out that my issue was with the url for the image. There appeared to be a different resolution. 
Another trouble that I ran into was pushing my thing onto github. I accidently moved where the HEAD was pointing to so I had trouble pushing my data onto github. After searching through the internet, I decided to use push --force. That ended up wiping out pretty much everything I have written, even for the previous assignment. So I had to start over again.
